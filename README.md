# batch-PBCore-XML-bash
Bash script for generating PBCore2 XML files

#Requirements
- CLI for Mediainfo
- basic text editor
- Bash shell (Unix based OS or Linux subsystem for Windows)

#Instructions
Copy shell script to text/code editor of your choosing, check it's saved as a ".sh" file

Be sure to change the output directory for the generated XML files in the script to the directory of your choosing

Place the ".sh" script in the same directory as the AV files you are working with, then in a Terminal window navigate into that
same directory and execute the script with the command: sh 'batch_PBCore_XML.sh' (or whatever you've renamed the script!)
